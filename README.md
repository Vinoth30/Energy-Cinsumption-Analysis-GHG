# Energy-Consumption-Analysis-GHG
Energy Consumption Analysis and and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations.

# Objective
Project will analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations, leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data. We aim to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint areas for improvement, informing data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

# Understanding the Data
The Dataset spans from 2012 to 2021 and contains information about BPS organizations, including public hospitals and school boards.Key attributes include organization details, operational information, energy consumption data, and GHG emissions.

# Data Preparation and Cleaning
1. Clean and transform the data into a format suitable for analysis by handling missing values, standardizing units, and deriving relevant features.
2. Segment the data by relevant factors like sector, organization type, and facility size

# Exploratory Data Analysis unsing PowerBI
1. Employ statistical analysis and visualization techniques to uncover key trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.
2. Investigate correlations between energy consumption, GHG emissions, and relevant features like building size, operational hours, and weather data.
3. Identify outliers and potential areas for further investigation.
4. Develop compelling and interactive visualizations using Tableau or Power-BI to effectively communicate key insights from the EDA.
5. Create dashboards showcasing energy consumption and GHG emissions by sector, organization, and facility type.
6. Design comparative visualizations to analyze performance trends and benchmark organizations against established metrics.

# Tools Used
1. Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2. Excel
3. PowerBI
